Dallas has officially been selected as one of the premier host cities for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, marking a historic milestone for the North Texas metroplex and American soccer. The announcement positions Dallas among an elite group of cities that will welcome the world's most watched sporting event when it comes to North America.

The decision to include Dallas in the tournament roster reflects the city's world-class infrastructure, passionate soccer fanbase, and proven track record of hosting major international sporting events. AT&T Stadium in Arlington, home to the Dallas Cowboys, will serve as the primary venue for World Cup matches, offering state-of-the-art facilities and a capacity exceeding 80,000 spectators.

FIFA officials praised Dallas for its comprehensive hosting proposal, which highlighted the region's extensive transportation networks, abundant hotel accommodations, and robust security infrastructure. The Dallas-Fort Worth International Airport, one of the busiest travel hubs globally, ensures seamless international connectivity for teams, officials, and fans traveling from around the world.

Local officials estimate that hosting World Cup matches could generate hundreds of millions of dollars in economic impact for the Dallas metropolitan area. The tournament is expected to attract tens of thousands of international visitors, boosting tourism revenue across hotels, restaurants, retail establishments, and entertainment venues throughout the region.

The 2026 World Cup will mark the first time the tournament returns to North American soil since the United States hosted in 1994. This edition will be particularly special as it represents the first jointly hosted World Cup, with matches taking place across the United States, Canada, and Mexico. The expanded 48-team format promises to deliver more games and greater global participation than ever before.

Dallas joins other confirmed American host cities in what promises to be a celebration of soccer on an unprecedented scale. The selection process was highly competitive, with cities nationwide submitting detailed proposals demonstrating their readiness to host the international tournament.

Local soccer enthusiasm has grown dramatically in recent years, bolstered by FC Dallas's presence in Major League Soccer and the increasing popularity of international soccer among American audiences. The World Cup matches in Dallas will undoubtedly inspire a new generation of soccer players and fans throughout Texas.

The tournament scheduling and specific match assignments for Dallas will be announced in the coming months. FIFA organizers are coordinating closely with host cities to ensure optimal fan experiences while managing the complex logistics of the world's largest sporting event.

For Dallas, hosting World Cup matches represents more than just sporting prestigeâ€”it's an opportunity to showcase the city's hospitality, diversity, and cultural vibrancy to a global audience of billions. The matches will create lasting memories for attendees while cementing Dallas's reputation as a premier destination for major international events.
